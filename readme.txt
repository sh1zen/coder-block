== Description ==

Now is very easy to share code in your website with Gutenberg and the power of [Ace](https://ace.c9.io/), an embeddable code editor written in JavaScript with the features and performance of native editors such as Sublime, Vim and TextMate.

Each instance of Coder Block support:

* Different languages: html, php, css, javascript, python,...
* Syntax highlighting with more than 10 themes to choose.
* Other options to select the font size of the code and lines to show without scroll.

With this feature each page will evaluate the code published within the coder block.
Up to now are supported PHP, Javascript and CSS only.
